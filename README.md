### Project Solution:
The included Jupyter notebook presents a proof-of-concept for a hybrid approach to simulating materials capable of selective diffusion via Quantum Sieving for Hydrogen Isotopes. It serves as the initial step in a pipeline that leverages classical methods to streamline subsequent quantum computer simulations.
The classical pre-screening demonstrated here aims to efficiently identify promising candidates, reducing the computational load on more resource-intensive quantum simulations. This approach highlights the potential synergy between classical and quantum computing in materials science research.
